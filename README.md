My passion lies between the ends of  front and back-end development, and my foremost concerns are object-oriented and user-centered studies. Extremely performed also in manipulating optical regime. A frequent contributor to system intensification or improvement*.*

The **knowledge** and educational qualifications I have gained to date have given me more opportunities to explore the various technological fields and their branches. When it comes to **web development**, I am well versed in working as part of a team to formulate and design **corporate websites** and handle challenging projects that require **extensive** coding modifications.
